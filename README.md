**The instructions specify adding the YAML files in the README, I have added them as separate files in this repository.**

## Task 2 answers

### MongoDB

To replace MongoDB we could use Azure Cosmos DB which can support the MongoDB wire protocol. It will be a good fit becuase it is compatible with MongoDB, there will be no servers to manage or persistent storage management. Auto-scaling is available while also being highly available.

### RabbitMQ

We can use Azure Service Bus to replace RabbitMQ as it supports queues, there is automatic failover and high availability, Azure manages authentication and there is no maintenance to be done as Azure is managed.
